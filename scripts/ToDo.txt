Trailer:
	introduce (who we are(CougAR lab)),
	tell what agents are and what they do in the enviroment. (collect food, survival skills, social skills)
	behind the scenes( how everything they are modularly designed, ),
	the plan: how we can run very large simulations on the server bcz of our design, collect behavioral data, 
	create better visuals & debugging. Create open access product & platform for everyone.
